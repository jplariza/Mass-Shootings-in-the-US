## Overview
In recent years, we have seen a spike in shootings. Withing the US, they have ranged from sprees to mass shootings in nearly all fifty states. Mass shootings are defined as events that result in 4+ deaths. What could be the cause of such tragic events? Do they happen more often in one state than the other? The datasets can be found at "<https://data.world/awram/us-mass-shootings>" and "https://www.openintro.org/book/statdata/index.php?data=gun_violence". Let us look at the trend of events over time and the demographics of shooters.

## Technologies Used
- R language
- Utilized libraries such as dyplyr, tidyverse, tidycensus, gganimate, ggplot2, plotly

## Code Structure
- Within the Rmd file, the code will be set up in blocks, where I first focus on a certain aspect of my analysis before providing commentary on my findings.
- I also denote, within my commentary, any challenges I faced and steps I took to make my analysis easier to follow.
